3)	(35 marks) We want to develop a system that calculates and displays the total gross earnings, 
tax payable, medical deduction and net earnings for employees of a fictional company. The user 
will input the four-digit employee number, hours worked (a positive integer) and the hourly rate 
of pay (an integer number between 10 and 100 inclusively) and the program will output. 

•	The employee gross earnings, which is calculated as: hours_worked * hourly_rate 
•	Tax payable, which is 20% of gross earnings if gross pay is less than or equal to $300, 30% otherwise. 
•	The medical deduction, which is calculated as 1% of gross earnings.
•	The net earnings, which is the gross earnings from which we deduct the tax and the medical deduction. 

a)	Generate test cases based on the problem specification. 

Test Cases
Valid
Input data: < 1000 5 10 >	Expected output: 50 10 0.5 39.5
Input data: < 9999 2 100 >	Expected output: 200 40 2 158
Invalid
Input data: < 999 5 10>		Expected output: INVALID
Input data: < 1000 0 10>	Expected output: INVALID
Input data: < 1000 5 9>		Expected output: INVALID
Input data: < 1000 5 101>	Expected output: INVALID
Input data: < 10000 2 100 >	Expected output: INVALID

b)	Write a C++ program for this problem and exercise all test cases of (a). 
Provide a report that contains the results of applying the test cases on the implementation, 
i.e., bugs found, etc.
